Biography
======

Hello! I am Huanhuan Chen, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. dr. ir. Inald Lagendijk](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/r.l.lagendijk/) and [Dr. Kaitai Liang](https://sites.google.com/view/kaitailiang) in the [Cybersecurity group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/cybersecurity) since July 2021.  Before that, I earned my Master’s degree in Mathematics from Nankai University.


I work in the field of applied cryptography. I am particularly interested in lattice-based cryptographic primitives and protocols, such as updatable encryption, fully homomorphic encryption, searchable encryption, and secure multi-party computation. I am also interested in the application of those cryptographic tools in privacy-preserving machine learning.

<span style="color: red;">I actively seek opportunities in the 2024-2025 job market and would be pleased to connect with those interested in my work. Please feel free to reach out!</span>
